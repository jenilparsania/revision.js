// declarative-programming paradigm : if the language follows the declarative paradigm,we write the code that specifies what you want to do , without saying how.

// imperative programming paradigm : if the language follows the imperative/procedural paradigm, we write the code that follows how to do something.


// JS is multi-paradigm language. 

//functional_programming
// because it is a sub-paradigm form the declarative paradigm, this affexts the way you write functional code. it generally leads to less code,because JS already has a lot of the in-built functions we commonly need.

// 2 laws to be followed to understand the functional programming 
// 1) you architect your software out of pure, isolated functions
// 2) you avoid mutability and side-effects
